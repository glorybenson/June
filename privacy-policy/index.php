                        <h3>What Does This Policy Cover?</h3>

                        <p>This Privacy Policy applies only to your use of Our Site. Our Site may contain links to other websites. Please note that we have no control over how your data is collected, stored, or used by other websites and we advise you to check the privacy policies of any such websites before providing any data to them.</p>

                        <h3>What Is Personal Data?</h3>

                        <p>Personal data is defined by the UK GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018 (collectively, “the Data Protection Legislation”) as ‘any information relating to an identifiable person who can be directly or indirectly identified in particular by reference to an identifier’.</p>

                        <p>Personal data is, in simpler terms, any information about you that enables you to be identified. Personal data covers obvious information such as your name and contact details, but it also covers less obvious information such as identification numbers, electronic location data, and other online identifiers.</p>

                        <h3>What Are My Rights?</h3>

                        <p>Under the Data Protection Legislation, you have the following rights, which we will always work to uphold:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>The right to be informed about our collection and use of your personal data. This Privacy Policy should tell you everything you need to know, but you can always contact us to find out more or to ask any questions using the details in Part 15.</li>
                            <li>The right to access the personal data we hold about you. Part 13 will tell you how to do this.</li>
                            <li>The right to have your personal data rectified if any of your personal data held by us is inaccurate or incomplete. Please contact us using the details in Part 15 to find out more.</li>
                            <li>The right to be forgotten, i.e. the right to ask us to delete or otherwise dispose of any of your personal data that we hold. Please contact us using the details in Part 15 to find out more.</li>
                            <li>The right to restrict (i.e. prevent) the processing of your personal data.</li>
                            <li>The right to object to us using your personal data for a particular purpose or purposes.</li>
                            <li>The right to withdraw consent. This means that, if we are relying on your consent as the legal basis for using your personal data, you are free to withdraw that consent at any time.</li>
                            <li>The right to data portability. This means that, if you have provided personal data to us directly, we using it with your consent or for the performance of a contract, and that data is processed using automated means, you can ask us for a copy of that personal data to re-use with another service or business in many cases.</li>
                            <li>Rights relating to automated decision-making and profiling. We do not use your personal data in this way.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>For more information about our use of your personal data or exercising your rights as outlined above, please contact us using the details provided in Part 15.</p>

                        <p>It is important that your personal data is kept accurate and up-to-date. If any of the personal data we hold about you changes, please keep us informed as long as we  have that data.</p>

                        <p>Further information about your rights can also be obtained from the Information Commissioner’s Office or your local Citizens Advice Bureau.</p>

                        <p>If you have any cause for complaint about our use of your personal data, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the Information Commissioner’s Office.

                        <h3>What Data Do You Collect and How?</h3>

                        <p>Depending upon your use of Our Site, we may collect and hold some or all of the personal and non-personal data set out in the table below, using the methods also set out in the table. Please also see Part 14 for more information about our use of Cookies and similar technologies and our Cookie Policy. We do not collect any ‘special category’ or ‘sensitive’ personal data, personal data relating to children and data relating to criminal convictions and/or offences.</p>

                        <h3>How Do You Use My Personal Data?</h3>

                        <p>Under the Data Protection Legislation, we must always have a lawful basis for using personal data</p>

                        <p>With your permission and/or where permitted by law, we may also use your personal data for marketing purposes, which may include contacting you by email, telephone, text message, and post with information, news, and offers on our services. You will not be sent any unlawful marketing or spam. We will always work to fully protect your rights and comply with our obligations under the Data Protection Legislation and the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003, and you will always have the opportunity to opt-out. We will always obtain your express opt-in consent before sharing your personal data with third parties for marketing purposes and you will be able to opt-out at any time.</p>

                        <p>Third Parties whose content appears on Our Site may use third-party Cookies, as detailed below in Part 14. Please refer to Part 14 for more information on controlling cookies. Please note that  we do not control the activities of such third parties, nor the data that they collect and use themselves, and we advise you to check the privacy policies of any such third parties.</p>

                        <p>We use the following automated system for carrying out certain kinds of decision-making and profiling. If at any point you wish to query any action that we take on the basis of this or wish to request ‘human intervention’ (i.e. have someone review the action themselves, rather than relying only on the automated method), the Data Protection Legislation gives you the right to do so. Please contact us  to find out more using the details in Part 15.</p>

                        <p>We will only use your personal data for the purpose(s) for which it was originally collected unless we reasonably believe that another purpose is compatible with that or those original purpose(s) and need to use your personal data for that purpose. If we do use your personal data in this way and you wish us to explain how the new purpose is compatible with the original, please contact us using the details in Part 15.</p>

                        <p>If we need to use your personal data for a purpose that is unrelated to, or incompatible with, the purpose(s) for which it was originally collected, we  will inform you and explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.</p>

                        <p>In some circumstances, where permitted or required by law, we may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent. This will only be done within the bounds of the Data Protection Legislation and your legal rights.</p>

                        <h3>How Long Will You Keep My Personal Data?</h3>

                        <p>We will not keep your personal data for any longer than is necessary in light of the reason(s) for which it was first collected. Your personal data will therefore be kept for the following periods (or, where there is no fixed period, the following factors will be used to determine how long it is kept):</p>

                        <h3>How and Where Do You Store or Transfer My Personal Data?</h3>

                        <p>We will primarily store your personal data in the UK. This means that it will be fully protected under the Data Protection Legislation</p>

                        <p>We may store some of your personal data within the European Economic Area (the “EEA”). The EEA consists of all EU member states, plus Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein. This means that your personal data will be fully protected under the EU GDPR and/or to equivalent standards by law. Transfers of personal data to the EEA from the UK are permitted without additional safeguards.</p>

                        <p>We may store some or all of your personal data in countries outside of the UK. These are known as “third countries”. We will take additional steps in order to ensure that your personal data is treated just as safely and securely as it would be within the UK and under the Data Protection Legislation as follows:</p>

                        <p>We ensure that your personal data is protected under binding corporate rules. Binding corporate rules are a set of common rules which all our group companies are required to follow when processing personal data. For further information, please refer to the Information Commissioner’s Office.</p>

                        <p>The security of your personal data is essential to us and to protect your data, we  take a number of important measures, including the following:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>limiting access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors, and other third parties with a legitimate need to know and ensuring that they are subject to duties of confidentiality;</li>
                            <li>procedures for dealing with data breaches (the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, your personal data) including notifying you and/or the Information Commissioner’s Office where we are legally required to do so;</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>My Personal Data?</h3>

                        <p>We will not share any of your personal data with any third parties for any purposes, subject to the following exceptions.</p>

                        <p>If we sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business or assets, your personal data may be transferred to a third party. Any new owner of our business may continue to use your personal data in the same way(s) that we have used it, as specified in this Privacy Policy.</p>

                        <p>In some limited circumstances, we may be legally required to share certain personal data, which might include yours, if we are involved in legal proceedings or complying with legal obligations, a court order, or the instructions of a government authority.</p>

                        <p>If any of your personal data is shared with a third party, as described above, we will take steps to ensure that your personal data is handled safely, securely, and in accordance with your rights, our obligations, and the third party’s obligations under the law, as described above in Part 9.</p>

                        <p>If any personal data is transferred outside of the UK, we will take suitable steps in order to ensure that your personal data is treated just as safely and securely as it would be within the UK and under the Data Protection Legislation, as explained above in Part 9.</p>

                        <p>If we sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business or assets, your personal data may be transferred to a third party. Any new owner of our business may continue to use your personal data in the same way(s) that we have used it, as specified in this Privacy Policy.</p>

                        <p>In some limited circumstances, we may be legally required to share certain personal data, which might include yours, if we are involved in legal proceedings or complying with legal obligations, a court order, or the instructions of a government authority.</p>

                        <h3>How Can I Control My Personal Data?</h3>

                        <p>In addition to your rights under the Data Protection Legislation, set out in Part 5, when you submit personal data via Our Site, you may be given options to restrict our use of your personal data. In particular, we aim to give you strong controls on our use of your data for direct marketing purposes (including the ability to opt-out of receiving emails from us which you may do by unsubscribing using the links provided in our emails and at the point of providing your details and by managing your Account.</p>

                        <p>You may also wish to sign up to one or more of the preference services operating in the UK: The Telephone Preference Service (“the TPS”), the Corporate Telephone Preference Service (“the CTPS”), and the Mailing Preference Service (“the MPS”). These may help to prevent you receiving unsolicited marketing. Please note, however, that these services will not prevent you from receiving marketing communications that you have consented to receiving.</p>

                        <h3>Can I Withhold Information?</h3>

                        <p>You may access certain areas of Our Site without providing any personal data at all. However, to use all features and functions available on Our Site you may be required to submit or allow for the collection of certain data.]</p>

                        <p>You may restrict our use of Cookies. For more information, see Part 14 and our Cookie Policy.</p>

                        <h3>How Can I Access My Personal Data?</h3>

                        <p>If you want to know what personal data we have about you, you can ask us for details of that personal data and for a copy of it (where any such personal data is held). This is known as a “subject access request”.</p>

                        <p>All subject access requests should be made in writing and sent to the email or postal addresses shown in Part 15. To make this as easy as possible for you, a Subject Access Request Form is available for you to use. You do not have to use this form, but it is the easiest way to tell us everything we need to know to respond to your request as quickly as possible.</p>

                        <p>There is not normally any charge for a subject access request. If your request is ‘manifestly unfounded or excessive’ (for example, if you make repetitive requests) a fee may be charged to cover our administrative costs in responding.</p>

                        <p>We will respond to your subject access request within 3 weeks and, in any case, not more than one month of receiving it. Normally,[we aim to provide a complete response, including a copy of your personal data within that time. In some cases, however, particularly if your request is more complex, more time may be required up to a maximum of three months from the date we receive your request. You will be kept fully informed of our progress.</p>

                        <h3>How Do I Contact You?</h3>

                        <p>To contact us about anything to do with your personal data and data protection, including to make a subject access request, please use the following details (for the attention of Matthew Boye)]:</p>
